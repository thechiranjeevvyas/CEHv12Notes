### 🔍 Scenario Summary

A critical incident has shaken Wareville. McSkidy has vanished, and with defenses already stretched thin, the festive season itself is at risk.

The response team’s first actionable lead points to **tbfc-web01**, a Linux-based server responsible for managing Christmas wishlists. This system may hold vital evidence, including:

* McSkidy’s most recent activity
* Early indicators of King Malhare’s involvement
* Subtle signs connected to the larger EASTMAS scheme

The investigation begins at the command line, where every directory and log file may tell part of the story.

### 🧩 Step-by-Step Investigation

#### 📌 Task 1 — Mission Briefing

> The opening sequence introduces the narrative through a visual confrontation between McSkidy and King Malhare. Symbolic elements—technology-infused artifacts and a robotic presence—signal that this is not a simple disappearance.

This stage establishes the context and defines the investigative direction.

***

#### 🖥️ Task 2 — Command-Line Orientation

Refreshed core Linux navigation skills, including:

* `ls` for directory listings
* `cd` to traverse the filesystem
* `pwd` to verify location
* `cat` and `less` to inspect file contents

These commands formed the foundation for controlled exploration of the server environment.

***

#### 🗂️ Task 3 — Filesystem Exploration

Systematically reviewed:

* Standard Linux directories
* User home paths
* Configuration and log locations
* Hidden files often overlooked

This phase revealed irregularities that suggested activity shortly before McSkidy went missing.

***

#### 📊 Task 4 — Log Examination

Shifted focus to evidence analysis by:

* Reviewing files under `/var/log`
* Inspecting command histories
* Correlating timestamps and user actions
* Identifying anomalies in access patterns

This process helped reconstruct McSkidy’s last known interactions with the system.

***

### 🎯 Objectives Achieved

* Gained confidence using the Linux CLI
* Understood how Linux systems record user behavior
* Applied basic investigative techniques to a real-world style scenario
* Connected technical findings with a narrative-driven objective

***

### 📚 Key Learnings

* Practical Linux navigation and file handling
* Reading and interpreting system and user logs
* Using command-line tools for basic forensic analysis
* Developing an investigative mindset for security-related tasks

***

### 💡 Core Insight

Small details matter. On a Linux system, even routine logs can quietly preserve the truth long after events unfold.
