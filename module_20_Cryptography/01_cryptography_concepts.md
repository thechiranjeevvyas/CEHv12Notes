# Section 01: Cryptography Concepts

## Concepts
Cryptography
> Cryptography, or cryptology (from Ancient Greek: κρυπτός, romanized: kryptós "hidden, secret"; and γράφειν graphein, "to write", or -λογία -logia, "study", respectively), is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversarial behavior.

Non-repudiation
> Non-repudiation refers to a situation where a statement's author cannot successfully dispute its authorship or the validity of an associated contract.

Encryption
> In cryptography, encryption is the process of encoding information.
> This process converts the original representation of the information, known as plaintext, into an alternative form known as ciphertext.

Symmetric encryption
> Symmetric-key algorithms are algorithms for cryptography that use the same cryptographic keys for both the encryption of plaintext and the decryption of ciphertext.
 
Assymetrics encryption
> Public-key cryptography, or asymmetric cryptography, is the field of cryptographic systems that use pairs of related keys.
> Each key pair consists of a public key and a corresponding private key.

GAK (Government access to keys) / Key disclosure law
> Key disclosure laws, also known as mandatory key disclosure, is legislation that requires individuals to surrender cryptographic keys to law enforcement.
