# Section 05: Cryptanalysis

## Cryptanalysis
Cryptanalysis
> Cryptanalysis (from the Greek kryptós, "hidden", and analýein, "to analyze") refers to the process of analyzing information systems in order to understand hidden aspects of the systems.
> Cryptanalysis is used to breach cryptographic security systems and gain access to the contents of encrypted messages, even if the cryptographic key is unknown.

Linear cryptanalysis
> In cryptography, linear cryptanalysis is a general form of cryptanalysis based on finding affine approximations to the action of a cipher.
> Attacks have been developed for block ciphers and stream ciphers.
> Linear cryptanalysis is one of the two most widely used attacks on block ciphers; the other being differential cryptanalysis.

Differential cryptanalysis
> Differential cryptanalysis is a general form of cryptanalysis applicable primarily to block ciphers, but also to stream ciphers and cryptographic hash functions.
> In the broadest sense, it is the study of how differences in information input can affect the resultant difference at the output.

Integral cryptanalysis
> In cryptography, integral cryptanalysis is a cryptanalytic attack that is particularly applicable to block ciphers based on substitution–permutation networks.
> It was originally designed by Lars Knudsen as a dedicated attack against Square, so it is commonly known as the Square attack.

Brute force attack
> In cryptography, a brute-force attack consists of an attacker submitting many passwords or passphrases with the hope of eventually guessing correctly.

Frequency analysis
> In cryptanalysis, frequency analysis (also known as counting letters) is the study of the frequency of letters or groups of letters in a ciphertext.
> The method is used as an aid to breaking classical ciphers.

One time pad
> In cryptography, the one-time pad (OTP) is an encryption technique that cannot be cracked, but requires the use of a single-use pre-shared key that is not smaller than the message being sent.
> In this technique, a plaintext is paired with a random secret key (also referred to as a one-time pad).

Birthday attack
> A birthday attack is a type of cryptographic attack that exploits the mathematics behind the birthday problem in probability theory.
> This attack can be used to abuse communication between two or more parties.
> The attack depends on the higher likelihood of collisions found between random attack attempts and a fixed degree of permutations (pigeonholes).

Hash collision attack
> In cryptography, a collision attack on a cryptographic hash tries to find two inputs producing the same hash value, i.e. a hash collision.
> This is in contrast to a preimage attack where a specific target hash value is specified.

Rainbow table
> A rainbow table is an efficient way to store data that has been computed in advance to facilitate cracking passwords.
> To protect stored passwords from compromise in case of a data breach, organizations avoid storing them directly, instead transforming them using a scrambling function – typically a cryptographic hash.

Padding oracle attack
> In cryptography, a padding oracle attack is an attack which uses the padding validation of a cryptographic message to decrypt the ciphertext.
> In cryptography, variable-length plaintext messages often have to be padded (expanded) to be compatible with the underlying cryptographic primitive.

Key stretching
> In cryptography, key stretching techniques are used to make a possibly weak key, typically a password or passphrase, more secure against a brute-force attack by increasing the resources (time and possibly space) it takes to test each possible key.
