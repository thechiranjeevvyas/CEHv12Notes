# Section 04: Email Encryption

## Email Encryption
Digital signature
> A digital signature is a mathematical scheme for verifying the authenticity of digital messages or documents.
> A valid digital signature, where the prerequisites are satisfied, gives a recipient very high confidence that the message was created by a known sender (authenticity), and that the message was not altered in transit (integrity).

SSL (Secure sockets layer)
> Netscape developed the original SSL protocols, and Taher Elgamal, chief scientist at Netscape Communications from 1995 to 1998, has been described as the "father of SSL".
> SSL version 1.0 was never publicly released because of serious security flaws in the protocol.

TLS (Transport layer security)
> Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide communications security over a computer network.
> The protocol is widely used in applications such as email, instant messaging, and voice over IP, but its use in securing HTTPS remains the most publicly visible.

openssl
> OpenSSL is a software library for applications that secure communications over computer networks against eavesdropping or need to identify the party at the other end.
> It is widely used by Internet servers, including the majority of HTTPS websites.

PGP (Pretty good privacy)
> Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is an encryption program that provides cryptographic privacy and authentication for data communication.
> PGP is used for signing, encrypting, and decrypting texts, e-mails, files, directories, and whole disk partitions and to increase the security of e-mail communications.

GnuPG / GPG (GNU privacy guard)
> GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG or GPG) is a free-software replacement for Symantec's PGP cryptographic software suite.
> The software is compliant with RFC 4880, the IETF standards-track specification of OpenPGP.
> Modern versions of PGP are interoperable with GnuPG and other OpenPGP-compliant systems.

Web of trust
> In cryptography, a web of trust is a concept used in PGP, GnuPG, and other OpenPGP-compatible systems to establish the authenticity of the binding between a public key and its owner.

S/MIME (Secure multipurpose internet mail extensions)
> S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) is a standard for public key encryption and signing of MIME data.
> S/MIME is on an IETF standards track and defined in a number of documents, most importantly RFC 3369, 3370, 3850 and 3851.
