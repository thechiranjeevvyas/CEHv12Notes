# Section 03: Public Key Infrastructure

## Public Key Infrastructure
PKI (Public key infrastructure)
> A public key infrastructure (PKI) is a set of roles, policies, hardware, software and procedures needed to create, manage, distribute, use, store and revoke digital certificates and manage public-key encryption.

CA (Certificate authority)
> In cryptography, a certificate authority or certification authority (CA) is an entity that stores, signs, and issues digital certificates.
> A digital certificate certifies the ownership of a public key by the named subject of the certificate.
> This allows others (relying parties) to rely upon signatures or on assertions made about the private key that corresponds to the certified public key.

RA (Registration authority)
> Registration authorities exist for many standards organizations, such as ANNA (Association of National Numbering Agencies for ISIN), the Object Management Group, W3C, IEEE and others.
> In general, registration authorities all perform a similar function, in promoting the use of a particular standard through facilitating its use.

Digicert
> DigiCert, Inc. is an American digital security company headquartered in Lehi, Utah, with offices in Australia, Ireland, Japan, India, France,South Africa, Switzerland and United Kingdom.
> As a certificate authority (CA) and trusted third party, DigiCert provides the public key infrastructure (PKI) and validation required for issuing digital certificates or TLS/SSL certificates.

Self signed certificate
> In cryptography and computer security, self-signed certificates are public key certificates that are not issued by a certificate authority (CA).
> These self-signed certificates are easy to make and do not cost money.
> However, they do not provide any trust value.
