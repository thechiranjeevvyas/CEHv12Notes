# Section 01: Cloud Computing Concepts

## Cloud Computing Concepts
Cloud computing
> Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user.
> Large clouds often have functions distributed over multiple locations, each of which is a data center.

IaaS (Infrastructure as a service)
> "Infrastructure as a service" (IaaS) refers to online services that provide high-level APIs used to abstract various low-level details of underlying network infrastructure like physical computing resources, location, data partitioning, scaling, security, backup, etc.

PaaS (Platform as a service)
> The capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer-created or acquired applications created using programming languages, libraries, services, and tools supported by the provider.

SaaS (Software as a service)
> The capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider's applications running on a cloud infrastructure.

Public cloud 
> Cloud services are considered "public" when they are delivered over the public Internet, and they may be offered as a paid subscription, or free of charge.

Private cloud
> Private cloud is cloud infrastructure operated solely for a single organization, whether managed internally or by a third party, and hosted either internally or externally.

Hybrid cloud
> Hybrid cloud is a composition of a public cloud and a private environment, such as a private cloud or on-premises resources,[100][101] that remain distinct entities but are bound together, offering the benefits of multiple deployment models.

Community cloud
> Community cloud shares infrastructure between several organizations from a specific community with common concerns (security, compliance, jurisdiction, etc.), whether managed internally or by a third-party, and either hosted internally or externally.

Fog computing
> Fog computing or fog networking, also known as fogging, is an architecture that uses edge devices to carry out a substantial amount of computation (edge computing), storage, and communication locally and routed over the Internet backbone.

Edge computing
> Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the sources of data.
> This is expected to improve response times and save bandwidth.
 
AWS (Amazon web services)
> Amazon Web Services, Inc. is a subsidiary of Amazon that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis.

Microsoft azure
> Microsoft Azure, often referred to as Azure, is a cloud computing platform operated by Microsoft for application management via Microsoft-managed data centers.

GCP (Google cloud platform)
> Google Cloud Platform, offered by Google, is a suite of cloud computing services that runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products, such as Google Search, Gmail, Google Drive, and YouTube.
